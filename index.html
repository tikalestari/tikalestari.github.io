   <h4>June 4, 2017</h4>
   <h3>Expectations</h3>
   <p>I'm expecting a lot of self-discovery through this class while learning the fundamentals of software engineering.
      I also expect to become a better team member through the projects that we do in the class.</p>
   <h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
   <p>This past week I found myself grabbing a cup of tea and enjoying my last free week of the summer. 
      I recently discovered a website called Pramp.com which is a free online peer-2-peer platform for 
      practicing technical interviews. So how it works is, you're matched with a random person based on availability, 
      practicing needs, and programming language preferences
      and you use a collaborative code editor to interview that person with a problem given by the website. And vice 
      versa; they interview you back. I did this about 5 times this past week and learned what areas I need to work
      on as far as prepping for upcoming tech interviews. </p>
   <h3>What's in your way?</h3>
   <p>My inner dark side of pepe the frog. I have all these goals in mind of what I need to achieve over the summer,
      but pepe says I should finish binge watching Suits. NO MORE PEPE. </p>
   <h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
   <p>I will start my SWE project early and hopefully finish early. I will also try to get ahead in this class and
      my other class, Intro to Computer Security. I'll also probably edit my blog page.</p>
   <h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
   <p>I have some experience in Python, although it was my first time hearing about the assert statement. I think
      it's pretty neat. I've never written test cases before, so that will be new. So will the other tools we will
      be using in the class. </p>
   <h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
   <p>Scroll up and read what I said about the website Pramp.com, it's my pick-of-the-week! You should definitely check it out.</p>
